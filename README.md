#App Overview

This R shiny app was a collaborative effort by Evelyn Guidry, Kail Amoakon, Sundari Kala, and myself, Christopher McManus for Chase Romanos Visual Analytics course at UNC Charlotte's School of Data Science. 

The goal for this shiny app was to provide potential hotel clientele with information on ideal booking times, what nights to book if the clientele is looking for a quiet night in, and details regarding cancelations for those that like to book last minute. 

To provide potential guests of either the resort or city hotel with information on ideal booking times, we filtered by year and sorted each graph by major U.S. holiday or month. Additionally, we included a lead time count to highlight the number of days before guests check-in. We couldn't forget about families and have provided a racing line graph to highlight which months are most popular for guests with kids. Furthermore, for guests looking for a quiet evening, we provided a count of the most booked nights to aid with the chance of getting some sleep or for relaxation, and filtered by hotel and sorted by week or weekend night. Also, we provide a count of types of people staying at either hotel for those looking to have an enjoyable experience. Lastly, for our procrastinators, we provide a count of which hotel sees the most cancelations by month, to highlight when the best chance of securing a reservation at the last minute.
