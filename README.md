# Hotel_Travel_Guide_App

This R shiny app was a collaborative effort by Evelyn Guidry, Kail Amoakon, Sundari Kala, and myself, Christopher McManus for Chase Romanos Visual Analytics course at UNC Charlotte's School of Data Science. 

The goal for this shiny app was to provide potential hotel clientele with information on ideal booking times, what nights to book if the clientele is looking for a quiet night in, and details regarding cancelations for those that like to book last minute.
